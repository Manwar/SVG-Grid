Revision history for Perl extension SVG::Grid.

1.02  2016-03-21T13:44:00
	- Patch image_link() to return the auto-generated id of the image element. Likewise,
		rectangle_link() returns the id of the rectangle element and text_link() returns the id
		of the text element.
	- Patch t/test.t to clean up the string name of the test.

1.01  2016-02-25T13:53:00
	- No code changes.
	- After I had a fight with github, git updated t/test.t to restore the obsolete name cell.svg
		instead of synopsis.svg as the file to be compared to the output of the test, so the test
		failed.
